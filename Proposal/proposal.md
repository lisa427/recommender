# <p align ="center">Group D - Too Fast, Too Furious? A Data Driven Look at Formula 1 Racing </p>

### Chosen Topic and Rationale: 
We've chosen this dataset and topic because there is a variety of data in this dataset to examine. The proposal has a variety of interesting visualization ideas that we've decided to run with.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020

### Inspiring Imagery:
1. Our first idea is to create a bar chart of the top 5 drivers of all time. This was our initial idea for an image of that.

2. With this bar chart, we will create a dashboard based on this image that populates with the driver data of whichever driver is clicked on.

3. Our next is to create a visualization of the number of wins per country that transitions from the beginning of our data to the end and shows perhaps the top 10 countries.

4.To further illustrate the data in #2, we will create a heat map displaying data on all wins by country using MapBox to create it.

### A Sketch
And here is a basic sketch of what we envision the project to look like. The black line in the center indicates a page separation between the two, with a navbar to navigate between them.
